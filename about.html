          <h2>"Land, Biodynamics, & Organics"</h2>
          <p>
            Our vineyards are organic and biodynamic, so we are in natural and
            healthy places. <br /><br />
            We farm organically & with biodynamic practices to work with nature,
            rather than against it. If our land is naturally healthy and full of
            diverse life, we have healthier vines, producing fruit with quality
            and flavour that expresses its unique and true environment.
            <br /><br />
            Organics means we don’t use any systemic sprays on our land, which
            would destroy the microbial life and ecosystems there. The land is
            the foundation for our vines, fruit and wine, so we want to look
            after it. Respect and care for land allows our vines to grow in
            natural balance and provides for generations after us.
            <br /><br />
            Offering wines to enjoy without any chemical residues is another
            motivation. We can drink wine that nurtures us, rather than affects
            our health, and our team tending the vines can work close up, free
            of chemicals.
            <br /><br />
            We also use biodynamics, a practice which energises and inspires us.
            Rooted in Rudolf Steiner teachings, biodynamics teaches us to see
            each of our three vineyards in a holistic way. All elements that
            make up our vineyards are considered – how they interact and make
            one healthy, vital whole. The vines, fields, forests, animals,
            plants, soils, compost, people and the spirt of the place are
            equally important. When all considered, our sites can build their
            own sustaining natural rhythms.
            <br /><br />
            Certified with Biogro 5202.

          <h2>"People"</h2>
          <p>
            We’re family owned. Nicholas and Pen are married with two gorgeous
            children who have grown up at the Home and Netherwood vineyards
            (that’s mum writing). Pen and Nicholas own and manage the business.
            Nicholas looks after our three vineyards and the wine making with an
            enthusiastic wine and nature loving team. Pen manages the business
            and looks over the restaurant and cellar door with a bunch of very
            fun, committed individuals. <br /><br />
            The dream is only possible with this incredible team of people who
            we thank every day for joining us. Quality and true expression of
            place can only happen when all of us connect with the land, the
            vision and each other. We’re learning from each other every day and
            grateful for what everyone brings to our vineyards and venues.
            <br /><br />
            And there’s more! Pen’s parents and siblings have invested in our
            land and vineyards since the beginning, making this dream possible
            in. the first place. Pen’s father Rod is a 5th generation
            horticulturalist from North Otago and has provided business advice
            on the journey. Pen’s mum Stacey provides much cheer and family
            support along with Nicholas’ parents. Jo and Cam, Pen’s siblings are
            supporters and offer fresh perspectives.
            <br /><br />
            The Christmas party is fun.
